% THESIS TITLE
% Specify the title. Set the capitalization how you want it.
\title{Towards Understanding Hierarchical Abstraction of a Software System   by Concept Cluster Tree}

% AUTHOR'S NAME
% Your name goes here.

% NAME OF ACADEMIC UNIT
%
% The following two commands allow you to specify the academic unit you belong to.
% This will appear on the title page as
% ``<academic unit> of <department>''.
% So if you are in the division of biomedical engineering you would need to do:
% \department{Biomedical Engineering}
% \academicunit{Division}
%
% The default is ``Department of Computer Science'' if these commands
% are not given.
%
% If you are in a discipline other than Computer Science, uncomment the following line and
% specify your discipline/department.  Default is 'Computer Science'.
% \department{If not Computer Science, put the name of your department here}

% If you are not in a department, but say, a division, uncomment the following line.
% \academicunit{Put the type of academic unit you belong to here, e.g. Division, College}


% PERMISSION TO USE ADDRESS
%
% If you are not in Comptuer Science you will want to change the
% address on the Permission to Use page.  This is done using the
% \ptuaddress{}.  Example:
%
% \ptuaddress{Head of the Department of Computer Science\\
% 176 Thorvaldson Building\\
% 110 Science Place\\
% University of Saskatchewan\\
% Saskatoon, Saskatchewan\\
% Canada\\
% S7N 5C9

% Since thesis chapters are very long and there are a lot of them, it is recommended
% that you put each chapter in a separate .tex file and \input each one of them
% in order.  For example:
%
% \input chap1.tex
% \input chap2.tex
