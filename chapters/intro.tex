\section{Motivation}
\label{intro:motivation}
  The growing demands of new requirements for software applications make the codebase large. As the life-cycle of software increases, more resources are devoted to the maintenance of the software. If developers want to add a new feature or fix bugs in the existing features, they need to understand related domain knowledge alongside relevant code structure. The ratio of reading code versus writing code in a software developer's role is over 10 to 1 \cite{martin2008clean}. In addition, if a new developer joins the team, they need to understand how the high-level feature maps with existing low-level source code. When a software developer has to implement a new feature or enhance an existing feature, they need to look for the relevant methods, classes and files to understand how different parts of the relevant code interacts. After getting a good grasp of the relevant codebase, the developer can start working on the new feature. The process of understanding source code is called program comprehension. However, depending on the knowledge a developer possesses for a specific codebase, the steps for comprehending the program can be different.
 
%  The process of looking for relevant codebase to fix a bug or implement a new feature is called concept location. Existing techniques for concept location focus on keyword based searching in the codebase. Code search engines return relevant files, classes when developers search for particular keywords. 
 
The program comprehension techniques mainly consist of two models ~\cite{tilley1998reverseEngineeringFramework, von1993programToolRequirements, siegmund2016programPastFuture}. One is the top-down model, where developers have the system's domain knowledge and tries to map bottom-level source code to the high-level domain knowledge (features in a system). In many cases, the developers lack domain knowledge, forcing them to go through low-level codebase and gradually build high-level knowledge. The process of cognitive mapping from source code to domain knowledge is called the bottom-up model. When the codebase is new or unknown to the developers, and they lack domain knowledge, generally, the bottom-up model is followed by the developers~\cite{wei2002surveyCategorizationComprehension, siegmund2016programPastFuture}. The top-down model is more flexible and efficient than the bottom-up model for developers to have some idea about what to expect in the codebase or where to start from~\cite{brooks1983theoryComprehensionPrograms}. 
 
 As program comprehension is an integral part of software maintenance, effective tool support for program comprehension will help developers do their day-to-day job properly and with minimal cognitive load. The tool support for program comprehension can save valuable human resources, which cut the overall cost for software maintenance~\cite{kruger2019features}. Developers prefer to have high-level domain knowledge and then map the source code to the domain knowledge~\cite{brooks1983theoryComprehensionPrograms}. However, in real-world scenarios, developers in the industry and open source projects have to resolve issues with no option except to follow the cognitive heavy bottom-up model. For example, GitHub, home to many open source projects, has 56 million developers who have completed 1.9 billion contributions\footnote{https://octoverse.github.com/} in the range of October 2019 - September 2020. The tech giants companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft have dedicated developer times for contributing to open source projects. Visual Studio Code, currently the most popular code editor from Microsoft, is developed by more than thousands of developers across the globe\footnote{https://github.com/microsoft/vscode}. The developers except the core team mainly fixed bugs or implemented new features where they are not familiar about the codebase. In the first step of their contribution, they must acquaint themselves with relevant parts of the codebase, which is the bottom-up model. Therefore, it is essential to have sophisticated tools to help the developers with the bottom-up model. Researchers work on abstracting source code based on call graphs to reduce the cognitive load when developers follow the bottom-up model. 


Method names are the lowest level abstraction in the source code. Method names represent a unit task of the overall system \cite{de2012IRMethodsArtifacts, starke2009searching}. The interaction between different methods is the building block to understand the high-level concept in source code. Call graphs are visual representations of interactions among methods in the system. Call graphs construction techniques are two types. The static call graphs are built by analyzing source code to find the caller-callee relationships among methods. Later, building a graph using the relationships where edges represent which method calls which method and nodes represent the method names. The dynamic call graphs are constructed by logging function invocations during the run-time. To generate dynamic call graph, the software system needs to be run for different scenarios. During the scenario execution, function invocations are recorded, which can be converted to a graph similar to the static call graph. The main difference between dynamic call graph and static call graph is that the dynamic call graph contains the only methods invoked during the execution where the static call graph includes all the methods in the codebase ~\cite{gharibi2018automaticStaticCluster}. The advantage of a dynamic call graph is that the call graph can be generated for targeted execution scenarios ~\cite{feng2018hierarchicalExecutionComprehension}. One disadvantage of the dynamic call graph is that it generates a massive amount of redundant data (logged information of repeated function executions), which is difficult to process. We have decided to use static call graphs to create a tool for supporting program comprehension models. 

As the static call graph properties align more to build abstract code summary, recently, few studies are utilizing static call graph to generate abstract code summary of a software system~\cite{gharibi2018automaticStaticCluster, walunj2019graphevoEvolutionCall}. In this thesis, we focus on enhancing the capability of abstract code summary from the existing research by addressing limitations. We also focus on the usability of the abstract code summary tree by building an interactive program comprehension tool
in a guided way according to their specific tasks.

\section{Problem }
\label{intro:problem}
% In this section, we state three sub-problems addressed in this thesis.
    \subsection{Sub-Problem \#1: Lack of human evaluation and comparison between IR techniques} In the literature, a great many studies have been performed to generate hierarchical abstraction of a software system using both static and dynamic call graph \cite{feng2018hierarchicalExecutionComprehension, gharibi2018automaticStaticCluster, xin2019identifyingFeaturesExecution}. The hierarchical abstraction is a tree like structure where execution scenarios are clustered and each node is labeled using different IR techniques on source code entities. The success of the abstraction tree depends on how well the labeling techniques perform. Different information retrieval techniques show promise in naming source code artifacts \cite{chen2016topicMiningRepositories, panichella2013topicModelsTasks, sun2016surveyTopicSE}. Although a lot of work exist on hierarchical abstraction, they lack comprehensive study on the effectiveness of different information retrieval techniques in labeling nodes of an abstraction tree with human in the loop. No empirical study exists to find which IR technique works well in which situation. Moreover, methods are treated as a unit \cite{gharibi2018automaticStaticCluster, feng2018hierarchicalExecutionComprehension} while using different information retrieval techniques for labeling nodes. Previous research \cite{de2012IRMethodsArtifacts} show that IR techniques perform better when more information like comments are used instead of method names. Therefore, using method names as unit provides less opportunity to retrieve the overall context.
    

    \subsection{Sub-Problem \#2: Abstraction nodes are too short for useful comprehension}
    In the previous studies \cite{feng2018hierarchicalExecutionComprehension, gharibi2018automaticStaticCluster}, nodes in the hierarchical abstraction tree have only few keywords extracted from method signatures. During our first study to evaluate IR techniques on labeling nodes, we observed that using 5-10 method names or words serves the purpose as a title for the node. The title can provide some context although it is difficult to comprehend what is happening inside a node without further detail. The content inside a node are execution paths which can be of variable length with many in quantity. Providing all the execution paths of a node to developers hinders the purpose of abstraction. Therefore, the challenge is to come up with a solution which can briefly provide context of a node without providing everything. 
    
   

    \subsection{Sub-Problem \#3: Making the abstraction tree usable for software engineering tasks} 
    
    New comers to open source software struggle with lack of domain knowledge. Usually developers (contributors) look for trending projects in their choice of language and popularity to contribute in social coding platforms (GitHub, Gitlab). As most of the time the problem being solved is unknown to the developer, developers struggle to map low-level source code to high-level concepts. As it is stated in previous studies [cite], developers prefer Top-down model to browser source code for program comprehension. In top-down model developers have some domain knowledge, which they later try to map with source code. The hierarchical abstraction tree have the potential to bridge the gap between top-down and bottom-up cognition model. However, the challenge is how to tailor the abstraction tree for the developers to use for a specific task in hand or targeting a specific unit of source code (method). 
    
    % Hierarchical abstraction tree help developers to understand high-level domain knowledge. When developers have domain knowledge, they tend to follow top-down model. As the abstraction tree captures high-level summary of whole software system, it is difficult to browse the abstraction tree for a specific task in hand. Browsing the abstraction tree by a guided way driven by task in hand can make the tree more usable in software maintenance. 
    
\section{Research Questions}   
\label{intro:research_questions}
While considering the above problems discussed in Section \ref{intro:problem}, we came up with below mentioned five research questions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1: How well the automatic labeling with the candidate approaches perform compared to manual labeling?
    \item RQ2: What are the developers preferences between method name versus words in method name variation of labeling techniques?
    \item RQ3: How can we provide a natural text summary to an abstraction nodes?
    \item RQ4: How can we provide significant patterns in execution paths for each abstraction node?
    \item RQ5: How can we make the abstraction tree useful for daily day-to-day software engineering jobs?
    
\end{itemize}

Research question one and two correspond to \emph{sub-problem 1}, research question three and four correspond to \emph{sub-problem 2} and research question five correspond to \emph{sub-problem 3}. The main goal of this research is to help developers during program comprehension activities. 



\section{Solution}
\label{intro:solution}
Considering the three above mentioned problems statements (Section \ref{intro:problem}) in the domain of program comprehension, we contributed three studies. Below we have briefly discussed the three studies.  

\subsection{Labeling abstraction nodes and human evaluation}

In this study, by mining concepts from source code entities (names of functions/methods), we generate a concept cluster tree
with improved naming of the cluster nodes. Our motivation is to complement existing studies to facilitate more effective program comprehension for
developers to address \emph{problem statement \#1}. We apply three different information retrieval techniques such as TFIDF (Term frequency-inverse document frequency)~\cite{ramos2003usingTfidfRelevance}, LDA (Latent  Dirichlet  Allocation)~\cite{blei2003latentLDA}, and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)~\cite{deerwester1990indexingLSI} (i.e., each technique with function
names and words in function names variation) to name nodes of concept cluster tree generated by clustering execution paths. Our experiment found that among the techniques on average, TFIDF performs better with around 64\% matching than the other
two methods (LDA and LSI) that show 37\% and 23\% matching respectively with names suggested by the users for 12 cases. Besides,
the words in a function name variant perform at least 5\% better in user rating for all the three techniques on average for the use cases.
Our study draws on the existing research but considers more techniques and humans response for comprehending outputs using the three
techniques.

\subsection{Providing summary and significant patterns for abstraction nodes}

In this study, we develop two new techniques to supplement nodes information in hierarchical abstraction tree for better comprehension to address \emph{sub-problem \#2}. Generally methods are expected to come with documentation at the start with a single line describing what the function does unless the method is very short and obvious \footnote{https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html}. First, We tried to exploit this common practice for generating a brief text summary for each node. 
To complement existing techniques of labeling nodes, we add a text description to the node by summarizing all the method comments under that node. 

Second, execution paths in the call graph represent execution scenarios~\cite{salah2005scenariographer,pradel2009automatic}. Therefore, inspired by previous studies \cite{salah2005scenariographerReverseEngineering, pradel2009automaticUseageSpecification} we add significant patterns for each node by analyzing all execution paths under the node. We conduct an empirical study with three subject systems to evaluate the potential of the two proposed techniques. We found that proposed techniques complement existing abstraction tree although there are some challenges. By addressing those challenges, the proposed techniques will be more effective for program comprehension. 


\subsection{Usability study of hierarchical abstraction tree}
As discussed in the \emph{sub-problem #3}, making the abstraction tree browse-able with specific target is helpful for new contributors in open source software systems. Having a system which helps top-down cognition possible without domain knowledge can be a game changer for new contributors. In this study, we have built a system where tree can be browsed by selecting a specific method or class. When a specific method or class is selected, relevant concepts in the tree are highlighted. Moreover, developers can see information like files involved, number of execution paths, summary and frequent patterns of a abstraction node. To evaluate the effectiveness, we have collected expert opinion regarding the usability of the system. 

% In this study, we built an interactive system which help developers use the abstraction tree in a guided way to address \emph{problem statement \#3}. When Developers search with keywords in the tree, the system highlight the relevant nodes. So, the developers can browse the abstraction tree for specific task in hand. We conducted a user-study to evaluate the effectiveness of the system.
